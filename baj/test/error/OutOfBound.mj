 * This program is used to test whether your compiler can find out
 * the out-of-bound operations of array. For those operations that
 * can't be checked out at compile-time, your compiler should 
 * generate codes to check them at runtime.
 * The following program is wrong. Your compiler should find out the
 * errors as many as possible. And it's better to point out the exact
 * positions of the errors and output useful information.
